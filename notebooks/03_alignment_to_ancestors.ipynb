    "We recommend performing the ancestral inference in a high-performance computing environment. This notebook is an example that shows the steps taken and how the code should run.\n",
    "\n",
    "This calls\n",
    "+ Infer the maximum likelihood model of sequence evolution\n",
    "+ Infer a maximum likelihood gene tree\n",
    "+ Infer ancestors on the maximum likelihood gene tree\n",
    "+ Generate bootstrap replicates for the maximum likelihood gene tree\n",
    "+ Reconcile the gene and species trees (for non-microbial proteins)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of different parallelization requirements, the ancestral inference step uses two scripts run in sequence ( and *bootstrap-reconcile*). The `alignment-to-ancestors` function infers the evolutionary model, builds the maximum likelkihood gene tree, reconciles the gene tree with the species tree, reconstructs ancestors, and generates bootstrap pseudoreplicates of the gene tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "for statistical analysis in the bootstrap-reconcile script. The results produced from each of these processes in *alignment-to-ancestors* can be visualized as summary tree PDF files written out at each step. Reconstructing ancestors should take about a day for a reasonable alignment (1,000 columns, 500 sequences) running on a reasonable compute node (30 cores). \n",
    "\n",
    "The *bootstrap-reconcile* script reconciles each pseudoreplicate gene tree to the species tree and constructs the final branch supports. Bootstrap sampling the gene-species reconciliation is computationally intensive but can be readily parallelized. For a full alignemnt, it will likely take approximately a week spread across several cores.\n",
    "\n",
