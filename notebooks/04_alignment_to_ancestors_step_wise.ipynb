This includes the matrix for amino acid substitution (i.e., LG, JTT, WAG, etc.), the stationary frequencies for that model, rate variation parameters (ùö™ distribution, rate categories, etc.), and the proportion of invariant sites. Topiary uses a conventional method to find the best model (Abascal F, 2005). It uses RAxML-NG to generate a maximum parsimony tree from the alignment. It then optimizes branch lengths and other parameters using all 360 combinations of these model parameters implemented in the computational library that underlies RAxML-NG and GeneRax.

This automatically roots the tree and has been shown to improve the quality of reconstructed sequences (Groussin M, 2015). For this purpose, we use GeneRax, a new high-performance program for reconciling gene and species trees. Unlike other, heuristic, methods, GeneRax uses an explicit likelihood framework (Morel B, 2020).

(Previous steps in the pipeline ensure that all sequences that have made it to this step come from species that are present in the OTL database). Any polytomies in this tree are resolved arbitrarily prior to the reconciliation inference. Topiary runs GeneRax with the default parameters and the UndatedDL model (Morel B, 2020).

For this, we use RAxML-NG, which implements a standard marginal ancestral reconstruction method (Yang Z, 1995). (This differs from previous versions of RAxML, which used a non- standard reconstruction method that was not comparable to other approaches). RAxML-NG finds the amino acid at each site in each ancestor that maximizes the likelihood of observing the sequence alignment given the tree, branch lengths, and phylogenetic model. This returns a matrix of posterior probabilities for each amino acid at each site in the alignment for each ancestral node. Topiary extracts the sequence of the maximum likelihood ancestor, as well as the so-called altAll version of the ancestor that incorporates alternate reconstructed amino acids at ambiguous positions. It uses a default cutoff of 0.25 to identify ambiguous sites (Eick GN, 2016); this can be set by the user.\n",

The final output for this step consists of the gapped sequences of the maximum likelihood and altAll ancestors for each node. These have associated statistical supports: posterior probabilities for each reconstructed amino acid and support for gaps. Topiary also puts out a variety of summary graphs to help select high quality sequences.\n"

In particular, it is important to check ancestral sequences with low average posterior probability labels in the summary tree. Regions where the ML and altAll constructions have similar posterior probability represent amino acids in the protein sequence that are highly ambiguous given the multiple sequence alignment. Generally, we recommend moving forward with ancestors with high (>0.85) PP. However, functionally competent ancestors have been resurrected from reconstructions with an average PP > 0.75.\n",

        "To determine branch supports, topiary uses non-parametric bootstrapping (Felsenstein J, 1985). Briefly, RAxML-NG generates pseudoreplicate alignments by sampling columns, with replacement, from the input alignment. RAxML-NG then infers an evolutionary tree for each of these alignments. Topiary generates up to 1,000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates, using RAxML- NG‚Äôs automatic Extended Majority Rules (autoMRE) method with a cutoff of 0.03 to determine the exact number. The output from RAxML-NG is a collection of pseudoreplicate alignments and pseudoreplicate gene trees. Because we are reconstructing ancestors on the reconciled tree, we pass each pseudoreplicate alignment and gene tree into GeneRax for gene-species tree reconciliation, yielding a final collection of pseudoreplicate reconciled trees. Topiary then uses RAxML-NG to map these pseudoreplicate trees onto the ML reconciled tree as branch supports. Topiary also assesses convergence for the branch support estimate using the `--bsconverge` option.\n",
