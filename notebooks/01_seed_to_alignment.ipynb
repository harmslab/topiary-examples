        "1. **Choose the proteins of interest for your ASR calculation.** In our example, we included two paralogs: LY86 and LY96. The choice of proteins sets the scope of the evolutionary study. To study the deepest ancestor of LY86, we want to include LY96 as the relevant outgroup. In our experience, you generally want ~1-5 paralogs for a robust ASR investigation. As you add more paralogs, you need more sequences to resolve the evolutionary tree, slowing the calculation and—eventually—making the problem computationally intractable.\n",
        "2. **Determine the taxonomic distribution of the protein family.** LY86 and LY96 are found across bony vertebrates (humans and bony fishes, but not sharks). If you are unsure of the taxonomic distribution of your proteins of interest, we discuss BLAST strategies for asking this question in the online [topiary documentation](https://topiary-asr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol.html#determine-what-sequences-to-include).\n",
        "3. **Choose two or three key species with well-annotated genomes that span the whole taxonomic distribution of your proteins of interest.** For LY86 and LY96, we selected humans and zebrafish, covering the breadth of species over which these proteins are found. Choosing humans and chimps would be a poor choice, as this covers only primates; even choosing humans and chickens would be non-optimal, as this covers only amniotes.\n",
        "4. **Add sequences for each protein from your key species to the table.** These sequences are the basis for automatic dataset construction; they should therefore be high quality sequences: canonical rather than isoform, not hypothetical, not partial, etc. Our usual source for these seed sequences is Uniprot, but these can come from any source.\n",
        "5. **Compile a list of aliases for each protein.** The same protein can have different names across different databases and species. Even in the same genome, gene nomenclature can be inconsistent. By using a human-curated list of aliases, topiary is more effective at identifying sequences that truly correspond to the paralogs of interest. Aliases can be found in many online databases. (A list of databases is given in the [topiary documentation](https://topiary-asr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol.html#construct-the-seed-spreadsheet).)\n",

        "\n",
        "Before reconstructing a phylogenetic tree and ancestors, we strongly recommend inspecting and possibly editing the alignment. There are a variety of pieces of software for visualizing alignments, including AliView (Larsson A, 2014), JALView (Waterhouse AM, 2009), and MEGA (Tamura K, 2021). We generally use AliView because of its balance of utility and simplicity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Load the alignment fasta file in an alignment editor\n",
        "\n",
        "To edit the alignment load `06_alignment.fasta` in an alignment editor. The alignment file will be in the directory you specified for `out_dir` above. \n",
        "If running on Google Colab, download the `06_alignment.fasta` file onto your computer. Click on the folder icon on the Colab menu on the left side of the window. Navigate into the seed-to-ali folder (or the name you gave your output directory in the previous step), hover over `06_alignment.fasta`, click on the three dots to the right and choose `Download`. If you mounted your Google Drive it will be in `gdrive/MyDrive/google_drive_directory/seed-to-ali`, and is also accessible directly on your Google Drive. \n",
        "\n",
        "### (Possibly) edit the alignment\n",
        "\n",
        "There are differing views on whether to manually edit an alignment (e.g. [Catanach 2019](https://peerj.com/articles/6142/) vs. [Morrison 2006](https://doi.org/10.1071/SB06020)); the topiary package allows a user to manually edit their alignment but does not require it. We generally recommend making a few adjustments to alignments. Importantly, if we edit an alignment, we publish the alignment as supplemental material in the resulting manuscript so others can reproduce our work. \n",
        "\n",
        "IMPORTANT: when editing an alignment, *do not change the names of the sequences* as this is how topiary maps the alignment back into the dataframe. Also, *do not add sequences to the alignment*. (To add sequences, you should add them to the dataframe itself before writing out the alignment. See the advanced topiary notebook in the https://github.com/harmslab/topiary-examples for how to do so.)\n",
        "\n",
        "When editing alignments, we use the four \"moves\" listed below (see the [documentation](https://topiary-asr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol.html#visually-inspect-and-possibly-edit-the-alignment) for detailed instructions and examples).\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Trim variable-length N- and C-terminal regions from the alignment.** A huge number of sparse and variable columns will slow evolutionary analyses and will generally not provide enough signal to be reconstructed with confidence.\n",
        "2. **Delete sequences with long, unique insertions or deletions (indels).** Indels can lead to alignment ambiguity around flanking regions. Further, they provide no information for most ancestors, most of whom do not have the indel, while increasing the computational cost of the phylogenetic analysis. Note, we do not make internal edits to sequences (say, by deleting a long lineage-specific insertion) as this becomes difficult to track or justify upon future realignment steps.\n",
        "3. **Delete lineage-specific duplicates, selecting the sequence with the greatest sequence coverage.** The pipeline generally does a good job of deleting sequences in this class; however, if such sequences slip through, we delete them from the alignment. Because trying to align long, unique, and variable sequences can affect the alignment of other sequences, we generally use Muscle5 to re-align the full MSA after we perform steps 1-3. This can be done directly from AliView. (We will often iterate through steps 1-3 and full alignment several times.)\n",
        "4. **Finally, after we are satisfied that we have sequences of reasonable length and composition, we carefully inspect the alignment and may correct “obvious” local misalignments.** In our view, these edits makes the alignment a more accurate description of sequence homology than otherwise; however, we recognize that this is subjective and difficult to quantify. As noted above, we publish our alignment with our final ancestors to allow others to assess our judgement and promote reproducibility.\n",

        "### Save your alignment and read back into the topiary dataframe\n",
        "\n",
        "If you edited the alignment in the editor, save that edited alignment out as a `.fasta` file. \n",
        "\n",
        "The alignment file then needs to be read back into the topiary dataframe to infer ancestors. You have a two options to do this. \n",
        "\n",
        "+ Run the following cell. Change `aligned_dataframe` and `edited_fasta_file` to point to the relevant files. This will create an output file with the name specified in `output_file_name`. (If you are running on Google Colab, you should upload your edited fasta file to the relevant directory on your Google Drive. If you did not previously specify a Google Drive directory, click on the folder icon on the left of the Colab window, navigate to the \"content\" directory, hover over the directory name, click on the three dot menu to the right, and select Upload.)\n",
        "+ If you are using a cluster to do the ancestral inference steps (recommended), you can upload both your edited alignment and the topiary dataframe from the last step up to the cluster. You can then run a command line script: `topiary-fasta-into-dataframe 05_clean-aligned-dataframe.csv edited-alignment.fasta final-dataframe.csv`. This will create a new file (`final-dataframe.csv`) that can be fed into subsequent analyses. "
